# ComeFromTwitter

Intercept http packets and check the result! If you don't know how to load the extension manually, the sample can be tested directly through:

- Firefox addon site (works on Android): [ComeFromTwitter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/comefromtwitter/)
- Chrome store: [ComeFromTwitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhdimhjnfdljhmdhekbfkmogmohdmdef/)

Simple extension sample for modifying headers for certain urls or on click.

The code works on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox! Even on mobile browser!

The extension currently takes twitter's url as example, supports on-click header modification. The commented section means we can intercept and modify headers without user interaction, may be useful in some applications.
